# PSWRecV5 (WOF) -- Beauty dataset hyperparameters
# ============================================================================
#
# PSWRecV5 model architecture params are UNCHANGED from our RecBole config
# (configs/beauty/beauty_pswrecv5.yaml).  Training protocol params (seed,
# batch_size) are aligned to WEARec's framework for fair comparison.
#
# This file is for documentation/reference.  The actual values are passed
# as CLI arguments in the PBS script.
