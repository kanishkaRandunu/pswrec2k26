# ============================================================================
# PSWRecV6 (WOF) -- Beauty dataset hyperparameters
# ============================================================================
#
# V6 = V5 + Dynamic Phase Evolution (DPE).
#   - Phase filterbank is called inside the encoder loop at every layer
#     (shared weights) instead of once at the beginning.
#   - Zero new parameters; zero new hyperparameters.
#
# Uses tuned V5 best hyperparameters (lr=0.0003, dropout=0.5, n_heads=2).
#
# This file is for documentation/reference.  The actual values are passed
# as CLI arguments in the PBS script.
