# PSWRecV7 (WOF) -- Beauty dataset hyperparameters
# ============================================================================
#
# V7 = V5 + Dynamic Phase Evolution (DPE) + Cross-Frequency Phase Coupling (CFPC).
#   - DPE: phase filterbank called inside encoder loop (shared weights).
#   - CFPC: learnable [n_heads, n_bands, n_bands] band_coupling matrix in
#     attention.  Bands are mixed via softmax-normalised coupling before
#     computing phase scores.  Enables cross-frequency coherence detection.
#   - New params: n_heads * n_bands * n_bands = 2 * 4 * 4 = 32 (negligible).
#   - No new hyperparams (coupling is learned end-to-end).
#
# Uses tuned V5 best hyperparameters (lr=0.0003, dropout=0.5, n_heads=2).
#
# This file is for documentation/reference.  The actual values are passed
# as CLI arguments in the PBS script.
