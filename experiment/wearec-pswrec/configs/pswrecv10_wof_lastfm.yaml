# PSWRecV10 (WOF) -- LastFM dataset hyperparameters
# ============================================================================
#
# PSWRecV10 on LastFM, using the same tuned training hyperparameters as
# PSWRecV5 (lr=0.0003, dropout=0.5, n_heads=2) to make the comparison clean.
# Architecture and phase/filterbank settings mirror the Beauty V10 run.
#
# This file is for documentation/reference. The actual values are passed
# as CLI arguments in the PBS script.
