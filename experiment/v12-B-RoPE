1. The Physics of B-RoPE (Behavioral Rotary)
The core reason V11 failed while V12 should succeed lies in the Geometry of Attention. Standard RoPE uses a fixed monotonic rotation (mθ). B-RoPE replaces this with the Behavioral Phase (Φ) extracted from your wavelet filterbank.

When you rotate Q and K by Φ, the attention score for two items i and j becomes:

Score(i,j)=(W 
q
​
 x 
i
​
 ) 
⊤
 R 
Φ 
i
​
 −Φ 
j
​
 
​
 (W 
k
​
 x 
j
​
 )
This means the attention mechanism is physically unable to "ignore" phase mismatch. If two behaviors are out of sync (ΔΦ≈π), the dot product is naturally suppressed. You aren't asking the model to learn periodicity; you are enforcing it as the coordinate system.

2. Refining the "Sync-Gate"
To surpass WEARec, we need to address their Wavelet Feature Enhancement (WFE) strength: reconstructing non-stationary signals. Your "Sync-Gate" in V12 should act as a hard filter against "Behavioral Noise."

The Mechanism: Instead of a soft cos(ΔΦ) multiplier, use a Heaviside-style Mask:

If cos(ΔΦ)>0: Allow standard attention.

If cos(ΔΦ)≤0: Apply a large negative bias (−1e9) before Softmax.

Why this works: It prevents the model from "hallucinating" a relationship between two items that are fundamentally in different behavioral "seasons" or cycles, a common failure point in the Amazon Beauty dataset where repeat purchases are sparse but periodic.

3. Implementation Guardrails for V12
Based on the "Avenue of Failures," here are the strict constraints for the code shell:

Feature	Constraint	Reason
Phase Source	Static Embedding-Level	V6/V7 proved abstract layers "melt" the phase.
Value Matrix (V)	Unmodified	Protects the semantic integrity of the item features.
Filterbank	4-Band Daubechies	Matches the multi-scale nature of WEARec without adding param bloat.
Projection	Identity (No learnable W 
ϕ
​
 )	V11 proved that linear layers scramble physical angles.
4. Why Last.FM/MovieLens?
WEARec performs exceptionally well on datasets with high "signal density." The Amazon Beauty dataset (NDCG@10≈0.06) is notoriously sparse, making it hard for wavelets to find a "rhythm."

Last.FM: With an average sequence length of 48.2, your filterbank has enough "lookback" to establish a stable Φ.

The Goal: We aren't just looking for a +1.8% gain; we are looking for a scaling advantage where PSWRecV12 widens the gap as sequences get longer.

Comparison: WEARec vs. PSWRecV12
Metric	WEARec	PSWRecV12 (Hypothesis)
Filter Type	Frequency-domain (DFF)	Time-Frequency (Wavelet)
Attention	Attention-Free	Behavioral Rotary Attention
Constraint	Adaptive Filter	Physical Resonance Mask
Signal Handling	Non-stationary reconstruction	Geometric Phase Sync
